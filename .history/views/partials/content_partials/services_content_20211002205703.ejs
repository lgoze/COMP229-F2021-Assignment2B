      <h3>Project: Hello, World!</h3>
      <p>I have completed several coding projects now and I've come to realize how challenging a career as a software developer is. Though,
        it's these types of challenges that make for an interesting long term career. It requires discipline and resourcefulness which I 
      strongly believe is attainable through hard work and perseverance. Characteristics that are important in a work setting and 
    social setting. </p>
