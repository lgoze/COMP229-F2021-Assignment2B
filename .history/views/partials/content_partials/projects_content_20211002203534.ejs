      <h3>Project: Hardware</h3>
      <p>One of my first projects was building a computer. I didn't know how they worked until I got into PC gaming. I had a prebuilt pc that had decent specs but wasn't 
      capable of running the games my friends were playing. So little by little, I upgrade the hard drive, ram, cpu fan,
    and eventually I installed a second hand graphics card. I eventually saved up enough money to build a brand new pc from scratch and thoroughly
  enjoyed the process. After years of building more computers for myself and friends, I decided to dive into the software side and learn more about the
hobby I enjoyed doing. Which is how I became interested in Software Development.</p>
